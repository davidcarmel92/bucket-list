# BucketList Web App - Built with Node.js, React, Redux, Express, and MongoDB

Bucket List is an app where users can register and create a profile displaying a list of pins that represent Bucket List items. Users can add new custom pins, or get ideas for new pins from a pre-made gallery. The pins can be indicated as "To do", "Currently Planned", or "Already Completed". A user can then rate the pin on a scale of one to five. Users can comment or like the pins of other users, and can search for other users in the that use the web app. Users can also create a small visible profile that contains their bio and a list of favorite places.

This app was built with Node.Js, Express, React, Redux, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Bootstrap.
