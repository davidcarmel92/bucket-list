# BucketList Web App - Built with Node.js, React, Redux, Express, and MongoDB

Bucket List is an app where users can register and create a profile displaying a list of pins that represent Bucket List items. Users can add new custom pins, or get ideas for new pins from a pre-made gallery. The pins can be indicated as "To do", "Currently Planned", or "Already Completed". A user can then rate the pin on a scale of one to five. Users can comment or like the pins of other users, and can search for other users that use the web app. Users can also create a small visible profile that contains their bio and a list of their favorite places.

This app was built with Node.Js, Express, React, Redux, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Bootstrap.
